# Tweed Cloud

This repository contains the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) source for the Tweed Cloud website.

## Development

1. Install Hugo.
2. Run `hugo server` to view the site locally.
3. Run `hugo` to build the static files into the `public/` directory.

The output is ready to deploy on platforms such as Cloudflare Pages.

### Content guidelines

Each page should include the following front matter fields:

```
title: "Page title"
description: "Oneâ€“sentence summary shown in meta tags."
image: "/images/optional-social.jpg" # used for social cards
```

Use meaningful alt text for all images and keep headings in order. For long articles the automatic table of contents and previous/next links will appear.
