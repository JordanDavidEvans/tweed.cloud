I have an avid interest in computers and online stuff in general.

I am currently employed full time at Localsearch, a Gold Coast marketing agency, where I work in quality assurance for websites.

I have creative interests in photography and game design.

I hold a Certificate III in Information Technology from TAFE and possess extensive knowledge beyond that through self-teaching and constant learning.

From a young age I maintained Minecraft servers and even managed the funds that kept them online. Building those communities sparked my passion for crafting meaningful digital spaces. Today I channel that same energy into helping businesses share their passion digitally and cultivate communities around their brand.
