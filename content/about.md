Hi, I’m Jordan—a web QA specialist on the Gold Coast helping small teams ship fast, accessible and search‑friendly sites.

You can see a few [featured sites](/featured-sites) I've supported or [get in touch](/contact) to chat about your own project.

**Snapshot:** Based in the Tweed region and employed full time at Localsearch, I support businesses and agencies across Australia. My work blends manual testing with data‑driven insights so releases land clean and measurable.

## What I do now
- Functional and cross‑device testing to catch bugs before launch
- Accessibility checks (WCAG‑aware) so everyone can use the site
- Performance tuning with Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
- On‑page SEO fixes and internal linking to surface key pages
- Analytics and Google Tag Manager event validation for trustworthy data

## Skills & tools
Hugo, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, Axe, GA4, GTM, Search Console.

## How I got here
My web journey started with Minecraft servers I ran as a kid. I wrote the rules, kept the community funded, and learned how to solve problems quickly when something broke. Those early projects taught me to document changes, communicate with players, and keep an eye on uptime. That hands‑on experience pushed me toward professional web work. I earned a Certificate III in Information Technology at TAFE and have kept learning through self‑directed projects ever since.

## How I work
Each engagement begins with a conversation about goals and audience. From there I audit templates, assets, and third‑party scripts. I flag accessibility barriers, test performance on slow connections, and verify that events are tracked correctly. You receive actionable notes, optional fixes, and a follow‑up check after deployment to ensure nothing regresses. The aim is a smooth release and a site that keeps earning trust over time.

## What I'm learning now
Refining custom GA4 event tracking and diving deeper into automated accessibility testing.
